Hey friend,[Pause(26)] welcome to star revenge.[Pause(90)]\n\
Old school players will remember this one,[Pause(26)]\n\
it's the original Star Revenge![Pause(120)]\n\
Well,[Pause(40)] not exactly.[Pause(120)] You may have noticed something\n\
funny by this point...[Pause(240)][AutoNextBox()][SetSpd(1)][FFSpd(-1)][TransAbs(32,80)]\
[ShadedBGBox(0x18,0x120,0x18,96,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x80)]\
Thats right,[Pause(26)] this world is actually made of\n\
fragments from star revenge.[Pause(90)] A lot has\n\
happened in the world since Brodute's last\n\
release.[Pause(490)] In fact we skipped 3 whole\n\
Star Revenges before making it here.[Pause(240)][AutoNextBox()]\

I have so much to share,[Pause(80)] but you'll have to\n\
meet me in person with a power star before\n\
I get to all that.[TimeEndStr(240)]"]
