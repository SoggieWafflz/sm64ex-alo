Well as you have seen, the world of star revenge\n\
has been broken into fragments. You see the\n\
natural order was disturbed from the outside.\n\
The world Brodute ruled over has been upsurped\n\
by some unknown foreign bug like entity.\n\
Luckily as your friendly neighborhood dorrie,\n\
I can navigate the clusters to help guide you\n\
back to your rightful place, SR 5.5 the best SR.\n\
Theres 6 stars to collect, and in order to get\n\
them you have to appease the scuttling overlord.\n\
His guidance is as follows,\n\
\"Answer my questions,\n\
songs of mystery.\n\
Or you'll be dead\n\
before you count to three!\".\n\
Just jump into any pipe to start your timely\n\
death, but only after a message from our sponsor.\n\
\"Advanced Text Engine now available in native\n\
C code, download today! Also download RM2C, the\n\
perfect tool to convert any binary hack to\n\

free to ask me anytime."]

#how its made
HowMade = ["\n\
How its made, romhacking edition.\n\
First the hacker starts out with nothing but\n\
a blank copy of sm64. The hacker places his or\n\
her copy of the nintendo classic into their\n\
tool of choice to start the hack setup process.\n\
This particular hack was made using sm64\n\
decomp. After the setup is done, our hacker\n\
proceeded to steal all the level models from\n\
brodute.\n\
How is this possible you ask? Well a combination\n\
of several new tools were used to perfectly\n\
recreate all aspects of old levels in a way\n\
that was easily editable for decomp.\n\
First a port of the soutce game is made for\n\
decomp using RM2C. Details can be found at your\n\
local rom hacking forum. Once this process is\n\
complete our hacker now has access to all\n\
models, textures, music and object placement\n\
in C format allowing easy access, but that is\n\
just the beginning.\n\
Afterwards, using a special blender plugin,\n\
these levels can be imported into blender\n\
with near perfect recreation of\n\
the C specification in a fast64 compliant\n\
form. This allows our hacker to quickly and\n\
easily edit whats needed and export it back\n\
right away.\n\
Now you can combine and merge pieces from\n\
any older hack with complete ease and with\n\
almost no manual fixes required."]

#how do I get stars
StarTut=["Each level will start with a musical quiz.\n\
I will play a song from a Star Revenge level\n\
and if you can guess the right one you pass.\n\
If you get it wrong youll be damaged severely.\n\
After each question you'll have to traverse\n\
the level in question to go to the next question.\n\
Make it to the final level and you get a star!"]

#SR or SA
SR_or_SA=["Yes.\n\
Well you see its quite complicated. To explain\n\
the machinations behind the grand design of\n\
this game we first have to go over years of\n\
dorrie lore.\n\
In the beginning, there was a young boy and girl\n\
dorrie who lived in paradise. Well things\n\
some things happened and now we have to pay\n\
taxes. This made dorries very bitter. We even\n\
opened several business ventures such as\n\
a construction company, go kart rentals and\n\
a treasure hunting guild. Eventually we had\n\
enough, and we decided on world domination.\n\
Well and you know the rest hahaha.\n\
Anyway long story short you cant catch an\n\
apple from a tree you haven't planted yet.\n\
I hope that answers your question."]
