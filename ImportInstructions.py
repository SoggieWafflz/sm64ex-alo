This file will contain instructions on how to import RM2C data into the sm64ex-alo repo.
First you should always copy the exported folders (/src,/levels,/sound,/text,/textures,/actors) into your repo.
Then make sure you set RM2C inside the makefile to 1
Then to build for PC use this input to terminal: "make clean && make RM2CPC"
Then to build for N64 use this input to terminal: "make clean && make -j4"
By default, due to their high variability and unique names, no actor data will be included from RM2C output, you must
go per actor and either copy data from a custom.model.inc.c file to the model.inc.c file, or change the includes in group files.

Level specific models will go into a folder inside of /actors/ with the name of the level they belong to. You must copy these folders
over to their level folders. The directory should match the target level dir, and not overwrite any files. Textures should be pre written
to the target level directories.

If you have exported custom behaviors, check the /data/ folder for exported custom behaviors with labels, and associated disassembled functions with matching labels.
These are provided for reference only, they must be manually integrated into the repo.

Below are some warnings generated by RM2C during extraction.
It is expected to have many warnings for editor files and for roms with lots of custom content.

#add moving platform to c3 sub area

#all levels work but scrolls are messed up across the board
Levels with fog in sm64 editor and likely early versions of Rom Manager are completely broken and destroy the levels graphics and most non opaque objects.
I attempt to auto fix these, if there is any issue in these levels check fog first.

New models are detected by comparing the checksums of textures from the specific model.
The comparison models come from an unedited vanilla rom loaded into Rom Manager.
If a model is in this list, it has either an unrecognized ID or a new texture.
If a model is not in this list, it does not guarantee that it is unedited.

 model mario_geo_ in folder mario has a new model or new textures.

 model marios_winged_metal_cap_geo_ in folder mario_cap has a new model or new textures. **

 model unk_DL_0500c778_ in folder unk_bob_0500c778 has a new model or new textures.

******************************************************************************************

Collision models are loaded via behavior, not alongside the model. This means it can be more difficult to detect where exactly the collision belongs.
I attempt to guess based on what model the collision is first used with, but if I'm not sure, it will be logged here.
#both included
 Collision rr_geo_000860_ in folder rr/swinging_platform is unkown or found to be new. Used with Behavior bhvSwingPlatform.
 Collision rr_geo_0008F0_ in folder rr/elevator_platform is unkown or found to be new. Used with Behavior bhvRrElevatorPlatform.

Known methods of crashing:
*****************************************************************************
ALL BUILDS
IF CRASH ON BOOT - CHECK SEQUENCES
IF TITLE SCREEN LOOP - CHECK START LEVEL IN TWEAKS.INC.C
IF TEXTURES ARE MESSED UP - ALWAYS CHECK LEVEL FOG FIRST
IF ONLY ALPHA TEXTURES MESSED UP - MOVE FOG GEO LAYOUT TO LAYER 1/4 FROM 4/6
IF CRASH UPON ENTERING A LEVEL, CHECK OBJECTS. IF EDITOR, CHECK SCROLLS FIRST. IF NO OBJECTS BAD CHECK SEQUENCES
*****************************************************************************
N64 BUILD
IF SURFACE NODE POOOL OR SURFACE POOL FULL - ADD MORE TRIS TO EXT BOUNDS.H
IF CRASH ON STAR SELECT - PUSH FORWARD GODDARD SEGMENT IN SEGMENTS.H
*****************************************************************************

MORE ON AUDIO ERRORS:
On N64 build, a lack of proper audio memory allocation will instantly crash the game. If this happens, extend gAudioHeap in buffers.c
If you have issues with certain m64s sounding garbled, extend gAlBankSets in load.c (line 2000 about).
If sound cuts out at certain points, extend values in gAudioSessionPresets.
On all builds, if an out of bounds array access happens (often with high sequence numbers) the game will crash or have audio issues.
